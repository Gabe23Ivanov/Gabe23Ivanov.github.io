          <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p>When was the last time you heard your friend tell you a great idea? How about the last time when you told somebody your ideas on a certain topic? Sharing your thoughts with the world can create a positive or negative effect. It is up to you to decide what kind of effect you want to create.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Examples</h2>
          <p>1. For example, if you think that somebody is acting rude to you, then tell them that you don’t appreciate the way they’re acting. This will allow them to understand how you feel, and how they are treating you.</p>
          <p>2. If you want to make a positive impact on the world, it is important that you tell others your goals and dreams because then you will have a clear vision. By telling others your dreams, they might also get motivated or inspired.</p>
          <p>3. On the other hand, if your dreams and goals are bad or dangerous, people will probably tell you that you shouldn’t do them. This will give you a chance to prevent yourself from getting hurt.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In conclusion, telling people how you feel about their actions is critical to understanding boundaries. Inspiring your friends with ideas that you think about can possibly change their life. This is why sharing your thoughts, ideas, and opinions can change the world.
