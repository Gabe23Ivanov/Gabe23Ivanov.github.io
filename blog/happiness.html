          <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p>Society indirectly and directly tells us many things, but it is your decision whether or not to listen. There are many reasons why most people do not achieve levels of happiness. To understand what makes people happy, you will first need to know the truth about materialism. Materialism is defined as “a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual values.” The biggest mistake people make during hard, sad, or hopeless times is that they shower themselves in clothes, shoes, cars, and other materialistic things that <b>DO NOT</b> bring them happiness whatsoever. The reason why buying these <b>objects</b> will not make you happy is because they will not fulfill you, your needs, or solve your problems.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">A Story About A Man Named Jacob</h2>
          <p>To make this idea easier to understand, I will tell you a story about a man named Jacob. Jacob grew up in a small town in Wisconsin. He always felt out of place, like he didn’t fit in. His goal in life was to become the wealthiest person ever. By the time he got to college, he was surprised by the amount of debt he had accumulated. Soon, Jacob had been working two jobs, working hard everyday just to pay rent. Still, he had $35,000 in credit card debt from wasting money on things he could not afford. He was constantly trying to impress his peers by spending ridiculous amounts of money on expensive clothes, shoes, and jewelry. He soon realized that nobody cared about what he bought. This realization hit Jacob so hard and made him realize his biggest mistake. Jacob realized that he was wasting his hard earned money on things that did not make him happy, or impressed others. Ever since that day of realization, Jacob got rid of his credit card debt, and became a happier person who did not spend money on materialistic things, but instead, acquired skills over time that led him to success, happiness, and a better salary. This story represents many people in this world that made many financial mistakes, but eventually realized what they were doing financially was <b>wrong.</b> The main thing to learn from this story is that buying materialistic things will not add happiness to your life, and will not fulfill you.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">This WILL Make You Happy</h2>
          <p>After learning about the biggest mistake people make with money, I will now tell you three things that WILL make you a happier person if you apply and add them to your life.</p>
          <p>1. Positive Community</p>
          <p>Constantly being and spending time with people that uplift and teach you will cause your mood to go up. Humans are not made to be alone, they are made to be around people who bring them joy. Join groups and events and you will for sure meet lots of people and make new friends.</p>
          <p>2. Freedom</p>
          <p>In U.S.A, people have freedom to make decisions that are good or bad. There are consequences for bad decisions, but not everybody has freedom to do what they love everyday. A major reason why people are not happy is because of the slavery of 9-5 jobs. Work hard and find your passion, and morph your passion into a career. This will make your life full of happiness.</p>
          <p>3. Quitting Social Media</p>
          <p>I have learned many valuable things about social media that most people much older than me will never learn. Over a year of me having social media taught me why people are more sad when they use social media. The billions of people using social media experience the same things. Whether they like it or not, they constantly scroll down posts of people bragging and complaining. They constantly compare how many followers they have and why someone did not like their post. I will be honest with you, I used to do these things I am talking about. I used to compare my numbers with others, and complain about my post not getting enough likes. I never felt connected with people, but I was always seeing people look happy in their pictures on instagram. I felt lost like a person without google maps. The best decision I have made in my life so far was deleting social media. Once you understand how toxic social media is, you will delete it without a second thought. True happiness will enter your life once you get rid of toxic people. Getting rid of snapchat, instagram, facebook, twitter, reddit, and any other addictive media will make your life change in the most positive way. Be the <b>one in a million,</b> don’t follow the crowd, buddy. It will benefit you in the short and long term.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Success</h2>
          <p>True success <b>does not</b> mean having lots of money, or fame, or a certain amount of followers on instagram. True success <b>does</b> mean having a life that includes positive people, a positive and productive environment, and a clear vision that will lead you toward your goals. True success <b>does</b> mean being the <b>one in a million</b>, and not doing what society tells you to do. Make your own life, and don’t waste time worrying about negative things that are not in your control.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In conclusion, society indirectly and directly tells us many things that can drastically make our lives different than what success is. True success <b>does not</b> mean you have lots of houses, cars, money, or the newest shoes. Don’t follow the crowd and waste your time on social media. <b>Get rid of any negative things in your life.</b> If you are surrounded by negative people, get away from them quicker than a cheetah. You have a purpose in life, so find it and unleash your strengths. You've reached the end of this article, here, read <a href="codingprocess.html">another one.</a></p>
